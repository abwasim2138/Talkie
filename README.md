Gif related project 


 About: 
 
 Talkie allows users to search for their favorite gifs and add their own voices to them! 
 
 
 How to use: 
 
  After launching the app search for a gif (ex: minions) in the search bar provided via the first tab. 
 Given there are no network related issues, gifs should fill up the collection view. 
 You can tap the refresh button in the top right corner to get a batch of new gifs related to your search. 
 Choose the gif you want to record over, this will take you to an AVPlayer where you can preview the gif by pressing play. 
 
  To record, SWIPE UP (The background should turn gray in order to indicate a recording session).
 To cancel a recording just SWIPE DOWN or if you haven't recorded anything yet then Done works to. 
 If satisfied with the recording you can hit Done in the top left corner and the Talkie will have been saved. 
 
  The second tab will take you to your own collection of Talkies that you made. In order to play a Talkie just 
 tap!
 If you want to share a Talkie first tap on it and then hit the action button in the top right corner. 
 To delete a Talkie just swipe left on it and press delete.
